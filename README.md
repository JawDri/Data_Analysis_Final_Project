# Data_Analysis_Final_Project
This repository contains my full documentation of my final data analysis project

The goal of the final project is to predict next day's returns using daily stock data from Tunisia Stock Exchange. The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSE.

We need to make sure that we use a linear regression model along with the topics that we covered in class (Data visualization, correlation, PCA, FA, Residual Analysis...)
